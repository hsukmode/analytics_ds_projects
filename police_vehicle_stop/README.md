This is an original, end to end project that analyzed Sacramento Police Vehicle Stop data, from months of June onwards in 2017, all of 2018, and part of January in 2019

That data can be found here: http://data.cityofsacramento.org/datasets/a8cb4c137c824e939dca586c6dc77da9_0

The notebooks were done in this order:
understanding and cleaning data, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and predicting citation/arrest when pulled over by a police vehicle
